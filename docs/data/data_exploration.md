# Data Exploration Framework

## Overview

This document provides a framework for exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ESG Financial Assistant datasets. Use this as a starting point to understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of your data.

## Dataset Overview

### Basic Information

```python
# Framework for basic dataset analysis
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv("your-dataset.csv")

# Basic statistics to implement:
# - Dataset shape: df.shape
# - Number of unique companies: df['name'].nunique()
# - Number of industries: df['industry'].nunique()
# - Data types: df.dtypes
# - Missing values: df.isnull().sum()
```

### Key Metrics to Analyze

- **Total Records**: [To be determined after loading data]
- **Unique Companies**: [Count unique company names]
- **Industries Represented**: [Count unique industries]
- **Geographic Distribution**: [Analyze exchange locations]

## Data Quality Assessment

### Missing Values Analysis

```python
# Framework for missing value analysis
# Check which columns have missing values
# Determine patterns in missing data
# Calculate percentage of missing values per column
```

### Data Consistency Checks

- Ticker symbol formatting
- ESG score ranges (typically 0-100)
- Industry category standardization
- Date format consistency

## ESG Score Analysis Framework

### Distribution Analysis

```python
# Framework for ESG score distribution analysis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create visualizations for:
# - Environment score distribution
# - Social score distribution  
# - Governance score distribution
# - Total ESG score distribution
```

### Industry Comparisons

```python
# Framework for industry-level analysis
# Compare ESG scores across industries
# Identify top-performing industries for each ESG category
# Calculate industry averages and medians
```

### Correlation Analysis

```python
# Framework for correlation analysis
# Analyze relationships between:
# - ESG components (E, S, G scores)
# - ESG scores and stock performance
# - ESG scores and company size
```

## Stock Price Analysis Framework

### Price Data Quality

```python
# Framework for stock price analysis
# Check for:
# - Missing price data
# - Unusual price movements
# - Data freshness
# - Currency consistency
```

### Performance Metrics

- Price ranges and volatility
- Trading volume patterns
- Market capitalization distribution

## Survey Data Integration Framework

### Survey Analysis

```python
# Framework for investment survey analysis
# Analyze:
# - Demographic distribution
# - Investment preferences
# - ESG importance ratings
# - Risk tolerance levels
```

### Integration Points

- Match survey preferences with ESG scores
- Demographic-based investment patterns
- ESG awareness correlation with investment choices

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Basic Statistics**: Fill in the framework with actual data analysis
2. **Create Visualizations**: Develop charts and graphs for key insights
3. **Document Findings**: Record interesting patterns and anomalies
4. **Validate Data Quality**: Address any data quality issues identified
5. **Prepare for Modeling**: Ensure data is ready for machine learning applications

## Tools and Libraries

Recommended Python libraries for analysis:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `plotly` for interactive visualizations
- `scipy` for statistical analysis
